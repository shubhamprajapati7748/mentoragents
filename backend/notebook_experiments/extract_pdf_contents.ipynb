       "'IMPORTANT  NOTES  ON  THIS  B OOK  (DISCLAIMER )  ·  11\\nThis is the first tweet in a tweetstorm.\\n↓\\nThis is the second tweet. Tweetstorms are longer series of \\ntweets all threaded together, similar to a blog post.\\nBOLDED QUESTIONS\\nMany excerpts are from interviews by fantastic creators like \\nShane Parrish, Sarah Lacy, Joe Rogan, and Tim Ferriss. The \\nquestions are bolded. For simplicity and continuity, I do not \\ndistinguish various interviewers from each other.\\nNON-NARRATIVE\\nThis is a choose-your-own adventure book. Jump to anything \\nthat interests you and skip anything that doesn’t.\\nLOOK IT UP\\nIf you find a word or concept you’re not familiar with, look it \\nup. Or, read on to find more context. Some referenced ideas \\nare expanded upon later in the book.\\nCITATIONS\\nCitations (like\\xa0[1]) indicate the end of an excerpt. I’ve done my \\nbest to maintain context for smooth reading. Sources are in \\nthe appendix for reference. Some sources appear many times \\nand do not appear in order.'"
